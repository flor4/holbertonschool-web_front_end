## About the Project

This project focuses on building modern and accessible web pages using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.
**HTML** provides the structure and semantic meaning of the content, **CSS** is used to style and design the visual appearance, and **JavaScript** adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to the page.
Together, these three technologies form the foundation of all web development, allowing the creation of responsive, user-friendly, and engaging websites.
